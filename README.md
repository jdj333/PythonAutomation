# PythonAutomation

The purpose of this project is to store Python automation scripts that I use to generate HTML test reports, performance reports, and error reports. The reports are based on log files and can be emailed out to developers to resolve found issues issues. The idea behind this is to setup automated "feedback loops" as to get insights into development environments as to catch problems ahead of time and get those results to developers.
